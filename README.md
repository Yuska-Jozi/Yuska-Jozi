- 👋 Hi, I’m Joseph. @Yuska-Jozi is my GitHub handle.
- 👀 I’m interested in using code to build digital models that describe real world systems to sufficient depth and applying engineering principles to optimise them. My areas of interest include healthcare systems optimisation in low-resource-settings, maintenance management systems, supply chain and value chain optimisations, operations research and environmental engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD candidate with the School of Engineering Management at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa.
- 💞️ Familiar with tools such as Discrete Event Simulation, Agent-Based Modelling, System Dynamics and AI/ANNs.
- Programming and modelling tools: Python, Simpy, AnyLogic, Vensim, MySQL.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me by email on joseph.mwanza@gmail.com
