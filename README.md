- 👋 Hi, I’m Joseph. @Yuska-Jozi is my GitHub handle.
- 👀 I’m interested in using code to build digital models that describe real world systems to sufficient depth and applying engineering principles to optimise them. My areas of interest include maintenance management systems, supply chain and value chain optimisations, operations research and environmental engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD candidate with the School of Engineering Management at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, where I am researching the impact on sustainability of applying industrial ecology principles to agent-behaviours within an agent-based simulation of a global value-chain of low-carbon economy mineral resources, such as PGMs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on optimisation projects in the areas of value-chain modelling, using tools such as Discrete Event Simulation, Agent-Based Modelling, System Dynamics and AI/ANNs.
- Programming and modelling tools: Python, Simpy, AnyLogic, Vensim, MySQL (not an expert in any of these yet, but have worked on many small projects with each) 
- 📫 Feel free to reach me by email on joseph.mwanza@gmail.com
